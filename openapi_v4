    Welcome to our Nationex integration API.
    All of Nationex's APIS are organized around REST. If you’ve used RESTful APIs before, many of the concepts here will be familiar to you. 
    Each resource has a unique URL, and HTTP verbs are used to specify actions you want to perform on each resource. 
    All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

    # Introduction
    Here’s what you can do with our APIs :
    - Create, update, cancel shipment.
    - Get shipment current status.
    - Get shipment rates.
    - Get shipment manifest.
    - Get labels. 

    # API version
    We release new versions when we make backwards-incompatible changes to our APIs.
    The current version of our APIs is v4, so the base URL will always look something like this :

    **https://api.nationex.com/v4**

    # Requirements
      You need to get API keys from our IT team at **tech@nationex.com**. You will start with API devlopement key and when your ready to go live you will change your API for the production one.

    # Authentication
    Nationex Restfull API needs authentication:
      Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the `Authorization header` that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password. 
      For example, to authorize as demo / p@55w0rd the client would send Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==

    # Response code
    | Status Code | Description | Note |
      |----|----|----|
      |`200` |  OK - The request was successful (some API calls may return 201 instead on `PUT`).|  <ul><li>GET request returns a representation of the requested entity.</li><li>The body of other requests will be a Status entity.</li></ul>|
      |`201` | Created - The request was successful and a resource was created. |<ul><li>This cannot happen on GET or DELETE requests.</li><li>This will happen on POST and may happen on PUT requests. </li></ul>
      |`204` | No Content | <ul><li>The request was successful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is empty). </li></ul>|
      |`400` | Bad Request |  <ul><li>The request is invalid the body was missing required parameters and or parameter did not respect data validation see error messages in body.</li></ul>|
      |`401` | Unauthorized | <ul><li>Client authentication failed (invalid **user/password**). </li></ul> |
      |`403` | Forbidden | <ul><li>Access denied due to missing **Permissions**</li></ul>|
      |`404` | Not Found | <ul><li>No resource was found at this location (URI)</li><li>If the requested URL contains an **ID** , this means that we did not find anything matching the ID</li></ul>|
      |`405` | Method Not Allowed | <ul><li>Requested method is not supported for the specified resource. </li></ul>|
      |`406` | Not Acceptable | <ul><li>Request contains **Bad headers** for this request</li></ul>|
      |`5xx` | Server-Side Error | <ul><li>These codes should not be set programmatically and are reserved for unexpected errors. </li></ul>|
